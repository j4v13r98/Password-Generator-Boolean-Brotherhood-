# Password Generator - The Boolean Brotherhood
A customizable and entropy-aware password generator built in Python.
It allows users to create memorable but highly secure passwords based on a phrase, a number and the security requirements of different account types (banking, emmail, gaming, social media). 

The aim of this project is to overcome the _Password Paradox_. This paradox describes how humans tend to create passwords that are easy for us to remember but easy for computers to crack, such as short words, predictable patterns, or common substitutions. At the same time, passwords that are strong for computers to crack—long, random, and complex—are usually difficult for humans to memorize.
